<div class="album">Who's this Owen Johnson guy?</div>
<p class="song">Hi, I'm Owen Johnson, I'm a musician, web developer, it guru, and college student. I like walks, music, video games, and being a nerd in general. That pretty much sums it up.</p>
<div class="album">How is this music made?</div>
<p class="song">I make heavy use of <a href="http://affiliate.image-line.com/BDHJCDD483">FL Studio</a> to compose, produce, and master my tracks. I live in a dorm room at the moment, so a Digital Audio Workstation is really the way to go. I design some of my own synth instruments using software, and I made my own <a href="http://www.musicfromouterspace.com/analogsynth/YOUR_FIRST_SYNTH/YOUR_FIRST_SYNTH.html">analog synth</a> for fun once. I use midi to map out ideas in FL Studio, a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26ref_%3Dnb%5Fsb%5Fss%5Fi%5F4%5F4%26fsc%3D-1%26ih%3D3%5F0%5F1%5F0%5F0%5F0%5F0%5F0%5F0%5F1.144%5F224%26field-keywords%3Dkorg%2520nano%26url%3Dsearch-alias%253Daps%26sprefix%3Dkorg&tag=collimbealab-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=390957">KORG nanoKey</a> keyboard, a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002M8EEW8?ie=UTF8&tag=collimbealab-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B002M8EEW8">Akai Pro LPD8</a> drum machine, sleepless nights, and caffiene. Of course, when this all started, all of the fancy equipment wasn't there. I started out with a 486 packard bell pizza box and a chat mic.</p>
<div class="album">What's with the funny name?</div>
<p class="song">When I was trying to come up with band names, I had a laundry list of the stereotypical techno band names, and while reading them off to a friend, the name <i>chemicalnova</i> was grossly misheard as Colorful Limo. It was catchy and bizzare like the tunes. It stuck.</p>
<div class="album">How can it be free?</div>
<p class="song">It's not about the money. It's about sharing awesome music. Enough people buy CDs so that I can continue to have fun making music, and I make good enough music that people buy CDs. It's that simple. If you want to encourage me to make more music, grab yourself a nice CD from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00390711O?ie=UTF8&tag=collimbealab-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00390711O">amazon.com</a>.</p>
<div class="album">Can I remix Colorful Limo stuff?</div>
<p class="song">You sure can. I'll even give you <a href="/loops">some loops</a> and the creative commons license. If you do remix any of my stuff, please <a href="contact.php">let me know</a> because it makes my day.
