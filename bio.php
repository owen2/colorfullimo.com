<div class="album">What is Colorful Limo?</div>
<p class="content">Colorful Limo is awesome electronic music from Iowa by Owen Johnson. It's quirky techno with a groove that's both smooth and intense. Often experimental in form and sound, Colorful Limo music comes in a variety of flavors, all of which are electronic, and most of which are odd (and epic). In some tracks, you'll hear cameos of some homemade instruments including a schmidt inverter synth and a rubber band box. You'll also hear some less weird software synths designed and tweaked by Owen. All in all, it's music made for fun and for sharing. Enjoy! : )</p>
<div class="album">Who's this Owen Johnson guy?</div>
<p class="content">Owen Johnson is a college student, web developer, composer, and system administrator. He's very laid back and enjoys figuring out how things tick. That includes music. He started off recording silly noises as a kid, and it became the one hobby that stuck with him. Music helped him get over high school angst, celebrate good times, and procrastinate college exams. The more he learned about music and sound production, the more he loved it. And that's where Colorful Limo came from. </p>
<div class="album">Current Releases </div>
<p class="content">Expect an epic CD soon. And by soon, I mean within the next year.</p>
<p class="content">Wootalicious is availible on CD now (since 2009)! How about that?</p>
<p class="content">Dreamfire made a quiet release in 2006. There are only a limited number of homemade CDs out there, so if you have one, I think you're pretty cool. If you don't, you are probably cool anyway.</p>
<p class="content">There's lots of my music on torrents. Go ahead and download it, but if you want to give back to the one who spent lots of time and money making this music, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00390711O?ie=UTF8&tag=collimbealab-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00390711O">grab yourself a CD.</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=collimbealab-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B00390711O" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />
